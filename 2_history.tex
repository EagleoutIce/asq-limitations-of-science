This section will give a brief overview of some of the important contributions in history and the way in which they interact with the concept of a god.
As a summary, Figure~\ref{fig:timeline} presents all the persons mentioned in this paper and puts them in a time frame.

\paragraph{Plato}
The Athenian philosopher Plato, a disciple of Socrates, lived in ancient Greece roundabout 400~BCE.
While he is probably most famous for his school of Platonism, this document will focus on his views on consciousness and the interaction between body and mind.

Plato founded the Subject-Object-Problem, which was probably later processed epistemologically by Thomas Hyde in his dualism~\cite{plato360}.
From Plato's point of view, living beings are a construct of an ephemeral body and an immortal soul, whereby the soul is the life principle and the actual self of the living being at the same time.\footurl{https://www.spektrum.de/lexikon/neurowissenschaft/dualismus/3052}{2021-17-01}

\paragraph{Aristotle}
The Greek polymath and philosopher Aristotle was a student of Plato and worked directly with and after him.
His views on dualism are quite similar, he even indulged in the theory of multiple souls, some of which die with the body, while others remain~\cite{aristotle350,hicks2015aristotle}.
